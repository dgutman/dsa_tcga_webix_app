<h2>The Cancer Digital Slide Archive</h2>
 <p>The CDSA was developed by researchers at Emory University (David Gutman and Lee Cooper)
  To support the browsing of imaging data related to the Cancer Genoma Atlas (TCGA)<br>
	Email dagutman@gmail.com if you have any questions</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<button class="accordion">Do I need to login?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Nope!!  The images from TCGA are public, and don't require login to browse.  Our platform also
  supports web based annotations, and that feature does require a login.  You need to know who drew what in order to save and analyze it!
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can I link to images?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We do not currently have any restrictions on linking to images/data in the portal.  In web-speak,
  CORS is not enabled.  If you want to directly link to a specific patient there is
  very basic API that allows you to navigate to a specific patient by TCGA ID<br>
  https://cancer.digitalsliderachive.org/#!/CDSA/byPatientID/<TCGA-Patient-ID><br>
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What other info is available?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Pathology reports are available for a number of images by clicking on the PATHOLOGY tab on the toolbar.
  In many cases additional clinical metadata is also available for some of the images by the metadata button.
  Since these images are associated with the TCGA, a rich array of genetics data is also available from companion web sites like https://cbioportal.org
